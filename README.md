## üöÄ About the Project

The **Work Request Management System (WRMS)** is a streamlined solution for managing work requests between operation departments and maintenance teams. The app enables teams to efficiently create, assign, and track requests in both **normal** and **strict** modes, providing real-time updates on timelines and roles.

### ‚ú® Problem It Solves

In industries with large-scale operations, managing maintenance requests often leads to miscommunication, delayed updates, and unclear accountability. WRMS solves these problems by:

- Standardizing work request creation with unique identifiers (`wrNo`).
- Assigning roles and permissions for maintenance managers, shift engineers, and operation engineers.
- Providing an integrated timeline for tracking work progress in strict mode.
- Ensuring seamless follow-up for unresolved issues via follow-up requests.
- Simplifying role-based access control (RBAC) for secure and efficient management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Different roles for Managers, Shift Engineers, and Operation Engineers.
- **Strict Mode Tracking:** Ensures timelines and responsibilities are clearly defined.
- **Dynamic Work Request Numbering:** Generates unique `wrNo` with intelligent counters.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Track assignments and status changes with timestamps.
- **Validation & Security:** Powered by `zod` schema validation and `Clerk` for secure authentication.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first design using `Tailwind CSS`.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Backend:** Server Actions in Next.js, [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (hosted on [Neon](https://neon.tech/))
- **Authentication:** [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/)
- **Validation:** [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- **State Management:** Zustand

## üì¶ Installation and Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **Bun** (for efficient package management)
- **PostgreSQL** (set up locally or use a managed service like Neon)

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raaahat/wrs.git
   cd wrs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   bun install

   ```

3. **Set up the environment:**

Create a .env file and configure the following variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=your_clerk_frontend_api
CLERK_API_KEY=your_clerk_api_key

```

4. **Set up the database:**

   ```bash
   bunx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

5. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   bun run dev

   ```

6. **Open in your browser:**

Navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## üìñ Usage

### Creating a Work Request

1. Log in as an authorized user.
2. Navigate to the "New Work Request" page.
3. Fill out the required fields such as title, area, type (Electrical or Mechanical), and remarks.
4. Submit the form to generate a new work request.

### Assigning Roles

- Maintenance Managers can assign engineers to work requests.
- Shift Engineers can oversee operation engineers in strict mode.

### Viewing Timelines

- Access the "Timeline" page to monitor strict mode work requests and track the progress of assignments and completions.

## üèÜ Why This Project Stands Out

- **Practical Use Case:** Tackles real-world challenges in industrial operations.
- **Scalable Design:** Built using modern frameworks and best practices.
- **Full-Stack Expertise:** Demonstrates proficiency in backend, frontend, and database management.
- **Security-Oriented:** Role-based access and robust validation to prevent misuse.
- **Job-Ready Features:** Perfect for showcasing skills like:
  - Server Actions in Next.js
  - Prisma ORM for relational database modeling
  - Clerk for secure authentication and role management
